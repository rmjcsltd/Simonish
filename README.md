# Simonish

One of the best ways to learn something is to do it, so I've done a little Microsoft Xamarin Forms development to get a feel for what it can do. I've created a small game called Simonish and taken it all the way through to publishing it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rmjcs.simonish) for Android. Whilst Xamarin Forms can also target IOS apps I'm not an Apple guy so I'll leave the Apple App Store for another time.

The game looks a bit like the classic electronic game Simon (originally launched by Milton Bradley in 1978) but is a lot easier to play, just requiring quick responses rather than a good memory.
